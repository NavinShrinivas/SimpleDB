# SimpleDB

This code awas written to be used as a really simpe backend for perf-test project of CS152 CLab project.This was made instead of simply using mongdb atlas becuase using atlas need the libmongoc drivers , which when it comes to portability and running flawlessly on both platforms (Win and Linux) highly lags behind.
